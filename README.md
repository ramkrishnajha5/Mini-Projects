# Javascript Mini Projects üë®‚Äçüíª

I have developed Mini applications using JavaScript, applying core concepts such as DOM manipulation, event listeners, local storage, and API fetching. With a solid understanding of ES6 features and modern JavaScript practices, I have successfully created dynamic, interactive web applications and used swiper JS.

## Projects Overview

### Weather application
A weather app that provides current weather data using APIs. The app allows users to enter a location, with the OpenCage API displaying matching location suggestions. Once the user selects a location or uses their current coordinates, the app sends the data to the Weatherbit API, which retrieves and displays the weather information. This interactive app offers a seamless experience for checking weather conditions based on user input or location.
### Todo List
A Todo app that allows users to enter tasks, mark them as done or undone, and delete specific tasks from the list. The app leverages local storage to save tasks, ensuring they persist across sessions for future interactions. Users can also reset all tasks, which clears both the task list and local storage, allowing them to start fresh with a reset.

### TextEmoji Converter
A text-to-emoji converter that transforms text into corresponding emojis by converting each character's ASCII value into its equivalent emoji decimal value. The app also works in reverse, allowing users to convert emojis back into text form.

### Rock Paper Scissor Game
A Rock-Paper-Scissors game where users pick an option, and the computer randomly selects one. The game displays whether the user wins, loses, or ties, and tracks the score. Users can refresh the page to start a new game with a reset score.

### Calculator
A calculator app where user can perform mathematical operations.
